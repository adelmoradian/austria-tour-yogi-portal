Horns program will be held in an open-space venue next to rather popular man-made lake.
The stage is fairy big (maybe 15m by 40m) and can possibly hold around 50 people at a time.

Right in front of the stage there is a hostel/hotel with super friendly staff. This might be
a good place for overnight accommodation!

Horn itself doesn't have a big population but the lake is popular with locals and people from
surrounding villages. According to local yogis there are hundreds of people in the area on summer days!

We are aiming to be there around 3pm for setup, start the program at 5pm, finish by 8pm and pack up by 9pm.

Horn has a few yogis and a small Sahaj centre in the middle of the town. Ideally the day after the program
we can go to the sahaj centre and maybe even (if we are lucky) invite some of the people from the program
over for some extended meditation session! Let's see... After lunch perhaps we can do some hiking or swimming in nearby
hills and rivers!
