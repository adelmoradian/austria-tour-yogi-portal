## Schedule and route
The tour will last for approximately two weeks from 16th to 31st of July and will focus on cities with fewer number of Yogis.
It will be possible to join only parts of the tour!

The schedule is as follows:
- 16th - Vienna
- 17th and 18th - Graz
- 19th and 20th - Klagenfurt
- 21st, 22nd and 23rd - Innsbruck
- 24th and 25th - Salzburg
- 26th and 27th - Linz
- 28th - St.Pölten
- 29th and 30th - Horn
- 31st - Wiener Neustadt and return to Vienna

As of now, most likely we will have venues in Wiener Neustadt, Horn, Linz, St.Pölten and probably Klagenfurt.
In these cities we will have music performance accompanied by meditation and self realization.
In Graz, Innsbruck and Salzburg we are planning to do more casual street realization.
We have not planned any programs for Vienna however being spontaneous is always an option!
Make sure to check out the [blog section](./posts/_index.md) for the latest updates!
