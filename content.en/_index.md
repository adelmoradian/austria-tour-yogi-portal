## General information

{{< tabs "uniqueid" >}}

{{< tab "Schedule" >}}
## Schedule and route
The tour will last for approximately two weeks from 16th to 31st of July and will focus on cities with fewer number of Yogis.
It will be possible to join only parts of the tour!

The schedule is as follows:
- 16th - Vienna and Graz
- 17th and 18th - Graz
- 19th and 20th - Klagenfurt
- 21st, 22nd and 23rd - Innsbruck
- 24th and 25th - Salzburg
- 26th and 27th - Linz
- 28th - St.Pölten
- 29th and 30th - Horn
- 31st - Wiener Neustadt and return to Vienna

As of now, most likely we will have venues in Wiener Neustadt, Horn, Linz, St.Pölten and probably Klagenfurt.
In these cities we will have music performance accompanied by meditation and self realization.
In Graz, Innsbruck and Salzburg we are planning to do more casual street realization.
We have not planned any programs for Vienna however being spontaneous is always an option!
Make sure to check out the [day plan](./docs/dayplan.md) and [concert details](docs/concerts.md) for the latest updates!

## Programs
The main theme of the tour is getting back to self and reconnecting with our deeper spirit.
This can only achieved (however momentarily) by letting go of our thoughts and being in meditation,
in the moment. We are using `in the moment` as the name of the programs.

A fanciful description can be:
>Swinging between work and studies, relationships and social life, tech trends and apocalyptic news,
>we rarely remember the true nature of our lives.
>With the help of meditation, music and art we hope to give you that rare opportunity to let it all go and be closer to
>your true self. With your spirit. Between the noise and beyond time. In the moment.

## Costs
The biggest factors are accommodation and transport. Some of the regional yogis have graciously offered to accommodate
the touring yogis while others have offered their car! These have greatly brought down the costs of joining and have made the
tour possible. For more details on our cost estimate see [Cost estimate](docs/costEstimate.md).

Currently we are expecting the total cost of joining the tour to be approximately 620 Euros per person.
This is still a lot so we are trying to reduce the cost of the tour by doing fund raising.
Our target cost for joining the tour is 350/500 Euros. We have decided to opt for having two prices so that
Yogis who can financially afford it, can pay a bit more to make it easier for the rest.

Keep in mind that both 350 and 500 Euros are subsidized and do need a decent amount of fundraising from the
collective! For our part, we will transparently update the collective on received donations and expenses of the tour.
If after the tour any funds are left over, they will all be donated back to the Austrian collective.
