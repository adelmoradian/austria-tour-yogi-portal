## General information

{{< tabs "uniqueid" >}}

{{< tab "Schedule" >}}
## Schedule and route
The tour will last for approximately two weeks from 16th to 31st of July and will focus on cities with fewer number of Yogis.
It will be possible to join only parts of the tour!

The schedule is as follows:
- 16th - Vienna
- 17th and 18th - Graz
- 19th and 20th - Klagenfurt
- 21st, 22nd and 23rd - Innsbruck
- 24th and 25th - Salzburg
- 26th and 27th - Linz
- 28th - St.Pölten
- 29th and 30th - Horn
- 31st - Wiener Neustadt and return to Vienna

As of now, most likely we will have venues in Wiener Neustadt, Horn, Linz, St.Pölten and probably Klagenfurt.
In these cities we will have music performance accompanied by meditation and self realization.
In Graz, Innsbruck and Salzburg we are planning to do more casual street realization.
We have not planned any programs for Vienna however being spontaneous is always an option!
Make sure to check out the [blog section](./posts/_index.md) for the latest updates!

## Programs
The main theme of the tour is getting back to self and reconnecting with our deeper spirit.
This can only achieved (however momentarily) by letting go of our thoughts and being in meditation,
in the moment. We are using `in the moment` as the name of the programs.

A fanciful description can be:
>Swinging between work and studies, relationships and social life, tech trends and apocalyptic news,
>we rarely remember the true nature of our lives.
>With the help of meditation, music and art we hope to give you that rare opportunity to let it all go and be closer to
>your true self. With your spirit. Between the noise and beyond time. In the moment.

{{< tab "Costs" >}}
## Costs
The biggest factors are accommodation and transport. Some of the regional yogis have graciously offered to accommodate
the touring yogis while in some cities we would like to camp in campgrounds to bring down the cost and also enjoy the
fabulous Austrian nature! The cost estimates are as follow:
- Total accommodation cost for the duration of the tour: around 250 Euros per person.
    This includes a combination of camping, staying with yogis and hostels.
- Total cost of transporting between cities: around 200 Euros per person. This assumes only using public transport and
    everyone buying a Vorteilskarte. It does not include hiring a van for transporting equipment but still a conservative
    estimate considering that many Austrians already have a Vorteilskarte and maybe some might even have Klimatickets.
    It is possible to bring down this cost significantly if the collective can provide a van/bus for parts or all of the tour.
- Total food cost: 192 Euros per person. Assuming 12 Euros per day for 16 days. We will try to prepare our own food when possible to reduce costs.
- Other costs such as venue hire, van hire and fuel, equipment hire, advertisement etc.:
    3000 Euro for the whole tour. This cost is divided between the participants (around 20 participants)

With the above assumptions, the total cost of the tour comes up to approximately 792 Euro per person.
This is obviously a lot so we are trying to reduce the cost of the tour by doing fund raising.
Our target cost for joining the tour is 350/500 Euros. We have decided to opt for having two prices so that
Yogis who can financially afford it, can pay a bit more to make it easier for the rest.

Keep in mind that both 350 and 500 Euros are subsidized and do need a decent amount of fundraising from the
collective! For our part, we will transparently update the collective on received donations and expenses of the tour.
If after the tour any funds are left over, they will all be donated back to the Austrian collective.
